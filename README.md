**Bayesian Inference (in STAN) Introduction workshop**

**Northwestern Univerity**


In this tutorial, we will walk through the basics of STAN- an open-source software for Bayesian inference. We will build a simple linear regression model in STAN and lightly discuss the advantages of using a Bayesian framework. We will be using STAN with Python, but STAN allows interfacing with R, MATLAB, Julia, Stata, and more.
